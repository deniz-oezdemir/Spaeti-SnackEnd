#### Run as a systemd service

1. Create a new service file:

```

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/ecommerce.service

```

2. Add the following content (adjust paths as needed):

```

[Unit]
Description=Ecommerce Spring Boot Application
After=network.target

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /home/ubuntu/app/app.jar
SuccessExitStatus=143
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

3. Reload and enable the service:

```

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable ecommerce
sudo systemctl start ecommerce

```

4. Check status:

```

sudo systemctl status ecommerce

```

5. Once registered, the deploy.sh script will automatically restart the service via:

```

sudo systemctl restart ecommerce

```

If the service is not registered, the script falls back to running the app with nohup.

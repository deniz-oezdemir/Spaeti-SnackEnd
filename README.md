This is the team project for the "Hero Tech Course 2025" by [Farhana](https://github.com/farhanaahmed), [Gabriela](https://github.com/knopgm), [Sara](https://github.com/saragrosser), and [Deniz](https://github.com/deniz-oezdemir).

## Introduction

We aim to implement an online Späti Shop where users can buy and gift snacks and soft drinks.

Instead of the physical delivery of said products we will send the details and images of the products to the user via a chosen channel.

## Product Categories

Currently we plan on not selling any of the age restricted products. So we will only sell snacks and soft drinks.

## User Flow

The user flow "Surprise" is currently out of scope:

Note: no age verification is needed.

## Feature List

Roughly in descending order of importance:
- User can choose between channels to receive product pictures
  - WhatsApp
  - Slack
  - Email
- Buying
- Gift sending – allow sending orders directly to someone else 
- Ranking – e.g., most bought products in each category 

Implement if there is enough time:
- Surprise Me – select random product(s) within user’s budget
- Age verification – verify user’s age before purchase
- Group buying – e.g., 6 beers for the price of 5, chips + soft drink combo discount
- Feedback – collect ratings or feedback for products/stores

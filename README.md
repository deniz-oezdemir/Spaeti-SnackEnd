## Introduction

We implemented an online SpÃ¤ti Shop where users can buy and gift snacks and soft drinks.

Instead of the physical delivery of said products we will send the details and images of the products to the user via a chosen channel.

## Project Implementation
Our development followed a structured three-sprint agile methodology, each focusing on a key phase of the project lifecycle.

### Sprint 1: Project Setup & Development Environment
Goal: Establish a robust foundation for collaboration and deployment.
